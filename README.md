# Forest-Cover-Type-Smote-
Objective was to predict Forest Cover Type on the basis of given geographical data. As the data on 7 cover types was not equally distributed / imbalanced, smote is used to deal with the problem. Cover Types with most data has been under sampled a little and cover types with less data has been over sampled accordingly so as to avoid much disturbance with original data.
